# CICDDOS2019
The CICDDoS2019 dataset, developed by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, contains network traffic data for various Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack types and normal traffic. It is widely used for training and evaluating machine learning models to detect and classify DDoS attacks in cybersecurity research.

This directory contains an analysis of this dataset for studying DDoS attacks. Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models for attack detection, and performance evaluation. The repository provides scripts, notebooks, and results to aid in cybersecurity research.
